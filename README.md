## what you will find on this profile

Here are many repositories, but which the most important repos, for me are:

<!-- TODO: Add images -->

### [Random Cat Bot](https://github.com/seokkuuu/RandomCatBot)

This repo is a **Facebook Bot** that uploads an image of a cat every 20 minutes. It's built using Python and my own **Facebook API Library** shown below.

### [Python Easy Facebook API](https://github.com/seokkuuu/python_easy_facebook_api)

This repo it's a minimal library for content creation automation on Facebook using Python. It has, for now few features, like create only text posts, image posts and text with image posts, but in the future, I will add more features.

### [MomoMaker](https://github.com/seokkuuu/momogen.cf)

This is just an site to create "momos" (memes) built in ReactJS. I'm currently working on this page to bring more templates and improve the performance, separating the image editing code to the backend, and bring a live image preview with a better UI.
